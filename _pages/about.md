I am currently a Postdoc Researcher at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT). I did my PhD at IRIT - Université Paul Sabatier under the supervision of [Lynda Tamine](https://www.irit.fr/~Lynda.Tamine-Lechani/) and [José G. Moreno](https://sites.google.com/site/jgmorenof/jose-g-moreno_1). My PhD research topic focused on the integration of structural knowledge into Pre-trained Language Models. 


Before my PhD, I earned my Master's degree at Université Paul Sabatier and a Bachelor's degree from the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería in Lima, Perú. I have had the chance to do some different research internships at IRIT (Toulouse), and SmartCityPeru Lab (Lima). Also, I worked as a software developer at Wolfram Research in Lima.


My research interests are centered around the fields of  Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Computation Linguistics
